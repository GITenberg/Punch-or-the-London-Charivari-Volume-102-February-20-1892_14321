    <h3>WRIGHT AND WRONG.</h3>

    <p>"We are getting on by leaps and bounds," remarked Mr. WILDEY
    WEIGHT, during a recent case. Whereat there was "laughter." But
    Mr. HORACE BROWNE, for Plaintiff, "objected to remarks of this
    kind." Then Mr. Justice COLLINS begged Mr. W. WRIGHT "not to
    make such picturesque interjections." Later on, Mr. HORACE
    BROWNE said to a Witness (whose name, "BURBAGE," ought to have
    elicited from Judge or Counsel some apposite Shakspearian
    allusion&mdash;but it didn't), "Then you had him on toast."
    This also was received with "laughter." But Mr. WILDEY WRIGHT
    did not object to this. No! he let it pass without
    interruption, implying by his eloquent silence that such a
    remark was neither a "picturesque interjection," nor
    sufficiently humorous for him to take objection to it. The
    other day, in a County Court, a Barrister refused to go on with
    a case until the Judge had done smiling! But&mdash;"This is
    another story."</p>

        initiated a Hon. Member of the Loyal Order of Ancient

    <h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. XXVI.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>On the Lagoons</i>. CULCHARD <i>and</i>
        PODBURY's <i>gondola is nearing Venice. The apricot-tinted
        diaper on the façade of the Ducal Palace is already
        distinguishable, and behind its battlements the pearl-grey
        summits of the domes of St. Mark's shimmer in the warm
        air</i>. CULCHARD <i>and</i> PODBURY <i>have hardly
        exchanged a sentence as yet. The former has just left off
        lugubriously whistling as much as he can remember of "Che
        faro," the latter is still humming "The Dead March in
        Saul," although in a livelier manner than at first.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, my dear PODBURY,
    our&mdash;er&mdash;expedition has turned out rather
    disastrously!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>suspending the Dead March, chokily</i>).
    Not much mistake about <i>that</i>&mdash;but there, it's no
    good talking about it. Jolly that brown and yellow sail looks
    on the fruit-barge there. See?</p>

             </a>"Reads with a gradually lengthening countenance."
    </div>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>sardonically</i>). Isn't it a little late
    in the day to be cultivating an eye for colour? I was about to
    say that those two girls have treated us infamously. I say
    deliberately, my dear PODBURY, <i>infamously</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Now drop it, CULCHARD, do you hear? I won't
    hear a word against either of them. It serves us jolly well
    right for not knowing our own minds better&mdash;though I no
    more dreamed that old BOB would&mdash;Oh, hang it, I can't talk
    about it yet!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> That's childishness, my dear fellow; you
    <i>ought</i> to talk about it&mdash;it will do you good. And
    really, I'm not at all sure, after all, that we have not both
    of us had a fortunate escape. One is very apt
    to&mdash;er&mdash;overrate the fascinations of persons one
    meets abroad. Now, neither of those two was
    <i>quite</i>&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>desperately</i>). Take care! I swear I'll
    pitch you out of this gondola, unless you stop that jabber!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with wounded dignity</i>). I am willing to
    make great allowances for your state of mind, PODBURY, but such
    an expression as&mdash;as <i>jabber</i>, applied to
    my&mdash;er&mdash;well-meant attempts at consolation, and just
    as I was about to propose an arrangement&mdash;really, it's
    <i>too</i> much! The moment we reach the hotel, I will relieve
    you from any further infliction from (<i>bitterly</i>) what you
    are pleased to call my "jabber!"</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>sulkily</i>). Very well&mdash;'m sure
    <i>I</i> don't care! (<i>To himself.</i>) Even old CULCHARD
    won't have anything to do with me now! I must have
    <i>somebody</i> to talk to&mdash;or I shall go off my head!
    (<i>Aloud</i>). I say, old <i>chap</i>! (<i>No answer</i>.)
    Look here&mdash;it's bad enough as it is without <i>our</i>
    having a row! Never mind anything I said.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I <i>do</i> mind&mdash;I <i>must</i>. I am not
    accustomed to hear myself called a&mdash;a <i>jabberer</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I <i>didn't</i> call you a jabberer&mdash;I
    only said you <i>talked</i> jabber. I&mdash;I hardly know what
    I <i>do</i> say, when I'm like this. And I'm deuced sorry I
    spoke&mdash;there!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>relaxing</i>). Well, do you withdraw
    jabber?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Certainly, old chap. I <i>like</i> you to talk,
    only not&mdash;not against Her, you know! What were you going
    to propose?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, my idea was this. My leave is
    practically unlimited&mdash;at least, without vanity, I think I
    may say that my Chief sufficiently appreciates my services not
    to make a fuss about a few extra days. So I thought I'd just
    run down to Florence and Naples, and perhaps catch a P. &amp;
    O. at Brindisi. I suppose <i>you're</i> not tied to time in any
    way?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>dolefully</i>). Free as a bird! If the
    Governor had wanted me back in the City, he'd have let me know
    it. Well?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, if you like to come with me, I&mdash;I
    shall be very pleased to have your company.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>considering</i>). I don't care if I
    do&mdash;it may cheer me up a bit. Florence, eh?&mdash;and
    Naples? I shouldn't mind a look at Florence. Or Rome. How about
    Rome, now?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Was I wise to expose
    myself to this sort of thing <i>again</i>? I'm almost sorry
    I&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) My dear fellow, if we are to travel
    together in any sort of comfort, you must leave all details to
    <i>me</i>. And there's one thing I <i>do</i> insist on. In
    future we must keep to our original resolution&mdash;not to be
    drawn into any chance acquaintanceship. I don't want to
    reproach you, but if, when we were first at Brussels, you had
    not allowed yourself to get so intimate with the TROTTERS, all
    this would never&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>exasperated</i>). There you go again! I
    can't stand being jawed at, CULCHARD, and I won't!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I am no more conscious of "jawing" than
    "jabbering," and if <i>that</i> is how I am to be spoken
    to&mdash;!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I know. Look here, it's no use. You must go to
    Florence by yourself. I simply don't feel up to it, and that's
    the truth. I shall just potter about here, till&mdash;till
    <i>they</i> go.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> As you choose. I gave you the
    opportunity&mdash;out of kindness. If you prefer to make
    yourself ridiculous by hanging about here, it's no concern of
    mine. I daresay I shall enjoy Florence at least as well by
    myself.</p>

    sure&mdash;very pleasant chat we had too! So you're at Venice,
    eh? I know every stone of it by heart, as I needn't say. The
    first time I was ever at Venice&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>as</i> CULCHARD <i>thrusts the letter
    angrily into his pocket</i>). You're new to Venice, I think?
    Well, just let me give you a word of advice. Now you <i>are</i>
    here&mdash;you make them give you some tunny. Insist on it,
    Sir. Why, when I was here first&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). I know. I mean, you told
    me that before. And I <i>have</i> tasted tunny.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Ha! well, what did you think of it?
    <i>Delicious</i>, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>forgetting all his manners</i>). Beastly,
    Sir, <i>beastly! [Leaves the scandalised</i> Mr. B.
    <i>abruptly, and rushes off to get a telegram form at the
    bureau.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mr. Crawley Strutt</i> (<i>pouncing on</i> PODBURY <i>in
    the hall, as he finishes the perusal of his letter</i>). Excuse
    me&mdash;but surely I have the honour of addressing Lord GEORGE
    GUMBLETON? You may perhaps just recollect, my Lord&mdash;?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>blankly</i>). Think you've made a mistake,
    really.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.S.</i> Is it possible! I have come across so many
    people while I've been away that&mdash;but surely we have met
    <i>somewhere</i>? Why, of course, Sir JOHN JUBBER! you must
    pardon me, SIR JOHN&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>recognizing him</i>). My name's
    PODBURY&mdash;plain PODBURY, but you're quite right. You
    <i>have</i> met me&mdash;and you've met my bootmaker too. "Lord
    UPPERSOLE," eh? That's where the mistake came in!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.S.</i> (<i>with hauteur</i>). I think not, Sir; I
    have no recollection of the circumstance. I see now your face
    is quite unfamiliar to me.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He moves away</i>; PODBURY <i>gets a telegram form

        CULCHARD.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>reading over his telegram</i>). "Yours
    just received. Am returning immediately."</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>do., do.</i>). "Letter to hand. No end
    sorry. Start at once." (<i>Seeing</i> CULCHARD.) Wiring to
    Florence for room, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Er&mdash;no. The fact is, I've just heard from
    my Chief&mdash;a&mdash;a most intemperate communication,
    insisting on my instant return to my duties! I shall have to
    humour him, I suppose, and leave at once.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> So shall I. No end of a shirty letter from the
    Governor. Wants to know how much longer I expect him to be tied
    to the office. Old humbug, when he only turns up twice a week
    for a couple of hours!</p>

    But look here&mdash;as things are, we may as well travel
    <i>home</i> together, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with a flicker of resentment</i>). In
    spite of my tendency to "jaw" and "jabber"?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, never mind all that now. We're companions
    in misfortune, you know, and we'd better stick together, and
    keep each other's spirits up. After all, you're in a much worse
    hat than <i>I</i> am!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If <i>that's</i> the way you propose to keep

            <p>So in the village inn the Poet dwelt.</p>

            <p>His honey-dew was gone; only the pouch,</p>

            <p>His cousin's work, her empty labour, left.</p>

            <p>But still he sniffed it, still a fragrance clung</p>

            <p>And lingered all about the broidered flowers.</p>

            <p>Then came the grocer, saying, "Hae some twist</p>

            <p>At tippence," whom he answered with a qualm.</p>

            <p>But when they left him to himself again,</p>

            <p>Twist, like a fiend's breath from a distant room</p>

            <p>Diffusing through the passage, crept; the smell</p>

    <p>COMPLICATED CASE.&mdash;The other day, an Italian

    "He admitted the charge" (we quote the <i>Globe</i>), "but said

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FKOM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 8</i>.&mdash;The
    coming of Prince ARTHUR anxiously looked for as Members
    gathered for last Session of a memorable Parliament. When, in
    August last, he, with the rest of us, went away, OLD MORALITY
    still sat in Leader's place. He was, truly, just then absent in
    the flesh, already wasting with the dire disease that carried
    him off. It was JOKIM who occupied the place of Leader; Prince
    ARTHUR, content to sit lower down. It seemed to some that when
    vacancy occurred JOKIM, that veteran Child of Promise, would
    step in, and younger men wait their turn. But youth of certain
    quality must come to the front, as BONAPARTE testified even
    before he went to Italy, and as PITT showed when the Rockingham
    Administration went to pieces.</p>

    <p>Prince ARTHUR came in shortly after four o'clock. House
    full, especially on Opposition Benches; faint blush suffused
    ingenuous cheek as welcoming cheer arose. Seemed to know his
    way to Leader's place, and took it naturally. Pretty to see
    JOKIM drop in on one side of him with MATTHEWS on the other,
    buttressing him about with financial reputation and legal
    erudition. <i>Tableau</i> quite undesigned, but none the less
    effective. Prince ARTHUR, young, hot-tempered and, though not
    without parts, prone to commit errors of judgment. But with
    JOKIM at his left shoulder, and HENRY MATTHEWS at his right,
    humble citizens looking on from opposite Benches, felt a sweet
    content. On such a basis, the Constitution might stand any
    blast.</p>

    <p>In absence of Mr. G., who still dallies with the sunshine of
    Riviera, SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, fresh from hunting in the New
    Forest, more than fills the place of Leader of Opposition. A
    favourable opportunity for distinguishing himself marred by
    accidental prevalence of funereal associations.</p>

    <p>"The Squire," said PLUNKET&mdash;watching him as, with legs
    reverently crossed, and elbow sympathisingly resting on box,
    carefully suggestive of life-sized figure of tombstone-mourner,
    he intoned his lamentation&mdash;"is not fitted for the part,
    and consequently overdoes it. <i>L'Allegro</i> is his line.
    <i>Il Penseroso</i> does not suit him."</p>

    <p>Everyone glad when, sermon over, and the black-edged folios
    put aside, the Squire began business. Happy enough in his
    attack on JOKIM, always a telling subject in present House of
    Commons.</p>

    <p>"He is," says SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, drawing upon his
    theatrical experiences, "like the Policeman in the Pantomime;
    always safe for a roar of laughter if you bonnet him or trip
    him up over the doorstep."</p>

    <p>For the rest, as Prince ARTHUR pointed out when he came to
    reply, Squire's speech had very little to do with the Address,
    on which it was ostensibly based. Couldn't resist temptation of
    enlarging on financial science for the edification of the
    unhappy JOKIM.</p>

    <p>"Finance," observed DICKY TEMPLE, "is HARCOURT's
    foible."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said JENNINGS, whom everyone is glad to see back in
    better health, "and funeral sermons are his forte."</p>

    <p>Through nearly hour and half the Squire mourned and jibed,
    Prince ARTHUR listening attentively, all unconscious of the
    Shades hovering about the historic seat in which he lounged, as
    nearly as possible, at full length&mdash;OLD MORALITY, kindly
    generous, pleased in another's prosperity; STAFFORD NORTHCOTE,
    marvelling at the madness of a world he has not been loth to
    quit; DIZZY tickled with the whole situation, though perhaps a
    little shocked to see a Leader of the House resting apparently
    on his shoulder-blades in the seat where from 1874 to 1876
    there posed an upright statuesque figure with folded arms and
    mask-like face, lit up now and then by the gleam of eyes that
    saw everything whilst they seemed to be looking no whither. PAM
    was there, too, with slightly raised eyebrows as they fell on
    the youthful form already installed in a place he had not
    reached till he was almost twice the age of the newcomer.
    JOHNNY RUSSELL, scowled at the intruder under a hat
    a-size-and-half too big for his legs. CANNING looked on, and
    thought of his brief tenure of the same place whilst the
    century was young. Still further in the shade PITT joined the
    group. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span></p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">

             alt="'THE COMING OF ARTHUR.'" /></a>

        <h3>"THE COMING OF ARTHUR."</h3>

        <p>Shade of Pam. "H'M! A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THE
        PART,&mdash;DON'T YOU THINK?"</p>

        <p>Shade of Dizzy. "WELL, YES! <i>WE</i> HAD TO WAIT FOR IT
        A GOOD MANY YEARS!&mdash;BUT I THINK HE'LL DO!!"</p>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>

    <p>"Well at least <i>he</i> was even younger when he came to
    our place," PAM whispered in DIZZY's ear, startling him as he
    inadvertently touched his cheek with the straw he still seems
    to hold in his teeth, as he did when JOHN LEECH was alive.</p>

    <p>Prince ARTHUR, facing the crowded Opposition Benches, of
    course saw nothing of this; lounged and listened smilingly as
    the Squire, having shaken up JOKIM and his one-pound notes,
    went oft to Exeter to pummel the MARKISS.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Address moved.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Evidently going to be an
    Agricultural Labourer's Session. Small Holdings Bill put in
    forefront of Programme. District Councils hinted at. In this
    situation it was stroke of genius, due I believe to the
    MARKISS, that such happy selection was made of Mover of
    Address.</p>

    <p>"It's trifles that make up the mass, my dear nephew," the
    MARKISS said, when this matter was being discussed in the
    Recess. "No detail is so small that we can afford to omit it.
    It was a happy thought of yours, perhaps a little too subtle
    for some intellects, to associate CHAPLIN with Small Holdings.
    In this other matter, let me have my way. Put up HODGE to move
    the Address. It will be worth 10,000 votes in the agricultural
    districts. I suppose he wouldn't like to come down in a smock
    frock with a whip in his hand? Don't know why he shouldn't;
    quite as reasonable as a civilian getting himself up as a
    Colonel or an Admiral. With HODGE in a smock frock moving the
    Address we'd sweep the country. But that I must leave to you;
    only let us have HODGE."</p>

    <p>So it was arranged. But Member for Accrington wouldn't stand
    the smock-frock. Insisted upon coming out in war-like uniform.
    Trousers a little tight about the knees, and jacket perhaps a
    trifle too tasselly. But made very good speech in the
    circumstances.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Bills brought in by the half
    hundred.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;Things been rather dull
    hitherto. House as it were lying under a pall, "Every man," as
    O'HANLON says, "not knowing what moment may be his next." Still
    on Debate on Address. When resumed to-night, CHAMBERLAIN
    stepped into ring and took off his coat. When Members saw the
    faithful JESSE bring in sponge and vinegar-bottle, knew there
    would be some sport. Anticipation not disappointed. JOE in fine
    fighting form. Went for the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD round after
    round; occasionally turned to aim a "wonner" at his "Right Hon.
    Friend" JOHN MORELY. Conservatives delighted; had always
    thought just what JOE was saying, but hadn't managed to put
    their ideas into such easily fleeting, barbed sentences. Only
    once was there any shade on the faces of the country gentlemen
    opposite. That spread when JOE proposed to quote the "lines of
    CHURCHILL."</p>

    <p>"No, no," said Lord HENRY BRUCE in audible whisper, "he'd
    better leave GRANDOLPH alone. Never knew he wrote poetry. If he
    did, there's lots of others. Why, when we're going on so
    nicely, why drag in CHURCHILL?"</p>

    <p>Depression only momentary. Conservative cheers rose again
    and again as JOE, turning a mocking face, and shaking a
    minatory forefinger at the passive monumental figure of the
    guileless SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, did, as JOHN MORLEY, with rare
    outburst of anger, presently said, from his place in the centre
    of the Liberal Camp, "denounce and assail Liberal principles,
    Liberal measures, and his old Liberal colleagues."</p>

    <p>After this it was nothing that, some hours later, O'HANLON,
    rising from a Back Bench, and speaking on another turn of the
    Debate, should observe, in loud voice, with eye fixed in fine
    frenzy on the nape of the Squire's neck, as he sat on the Front
    Bench with folded arms, "I do not believe in the Opposition
    Leaders, who have split up my Party, and are now living on its
    blood."</p>

    MIDDLETON moved for Royal Commission. MARKISS drew fine

    the fog itself, but its colour." Rather seemed to like the fog,
    <i>per se</i>, if only his particular fancy in matter of colour
    gratified. Didn't mention what colour he preferred; but fresh
    difficulty looming out of the fog evident. Tastes differ. If
    every man is to have his own particular coloured fog, our last
    state will be worse than the first.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>PROFESSOR HUBERT HERKOMER has "dried his impressions," and
    given them to the public in a handsome volume brought out by
    MACMILLAN &amp; CO. It is all interesting even to a
    non-artistic laic, for there is much "dry point" of general
    application in the Professor's lectures. Yet, amid all his
    learning and his light-hearted style, there is occasionally a
    strain of melancholy, as when he pictures himself to us as
    "etching and scratching on a bed of burr." Painful, very;
    likewise Dantesque,&mdash;infernally Dantesque. But there is
    another and a more cheerful view which the Baron prefers to
    take, and that is, the word-picture which the Professor gives
    us of his little room in his Bavarian home, where he says,
    "Under the seat by the table are my bottles"&mdash;ah! quite
    Rabelaisian this!&mdash;"with the mordants, and my dishes for
    the plates." Isn't this rare! "I should add, there is a stove
    near the door." O Sybarite! Doesn't this suggest the notion of
    a delightful little dinner <i>à deux</i>! With "the
    mordants,"&mdash;which is, of course, a generic name for sauces
    of varied piquancy,&mdash;and with his "dishes" artistically
    prepared and set before "the plates," as in due order they
    should be, he is as correct as he is original. A true <i>bon
    vivant</i>. The Baron highly commends the book, which only for
    the rare etchings it contains, is well worth the attention of
    every amateur of Art, and that he, the Baron, may, one of these
    days, dine with him, the Professor, is the sincere wish of his
    truly, and everybody else's truly,</p>

    <h2>IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM.</h2>

    <p>At a meeting of the Drury Lane Lodge of Freemasons, said the
    <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, "with all due solemnity was Mr. S.B.
    BANCROFT installed in the Chair of King SOLOMON." This, whether
    an easy chair or not, ought to be the seat of wisdom. Poor
    SOLOMON, the very much married man, was not, however,
    particularly wise in his latter days, but, of course, this
    chair was the one used by the Great Grand Master Mason before
    it was taken from under him, and he fell so heavily, "never to
    rise again." How fortunate for the Drury Lane Masons to have
    obtained this chair of SOLOMON's. No doubt it was one of his
    wise descendants, of whom there are not a few in the
    neighbourhood of Drury Lane, who consented to part with this
    treasure to the Masonic Lodgers. So here's King SOLOMON BUSY
    BANCROFT's good health! "Point, left, right! One, two, three!"

    <h2>WEATHER REFORM.</h2>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Acquiescence in the state of the weather is no
    longer <i>comme il faut</i>. Bombarding the Empyrean is as
    little regarded as throwing stones at monkeys, that they may
    make reprisals with cocoa-nuts; yet the success of the
    rain-makers is very doubtful. Their premisses even are
    disallowed by many considerable authorities. The little
    experiment which I propose to submit to the meteorological
    officials is founded on a fact of universal experience, and, if
    successful, would be of immense utility. Every smoker must be
    aware that the force of the wind varies inversely as the number
    of matches. On an absolutely still day, with a heavy pall of
    fog over the streets, the striking of the last match to light a
    pipe is invariably accompanied by a breeze, just strong enough
    to extinguish the nascent flame. Now if two or three thousand
    men simultaneously struck a last match, the resulting wind
    would be of very respectable strength&mdash;anemometer could
    tell that.</p>

    <p>My proposal then, is this. When anticyclonic conditions next
    prevail, and the great smoke-cloud incubates its cletch of
    microbes, let some 5,000 men, provided at the public expense
    with a pipe of tobacco and one match each, be stationed in the
    City, at every corner and along the streets, like the police on
    Lord Mayor's Day. At a given signal, say the firing of the
    Tower guns, each man strikes his match. Judging from the
    invariable result in my own case, this would be followed by
    5,000 puffs of wind of sufficient strength to extinguish the
    lights, or, better still, to give the 5,000 men some thirty
    seconds of intense anxiety, while the wind plays between their
    fingers and over their hands and round the bowls of their
    pipes. Multiplying the men by the seconds (5,000 x 30) you get
    approximately the amount of the wind, in wear and tare and
    tret. If this experiment were conducted on a duly extensive
    scale round London; say at Brixton, Kensington, Holloway and
    Stepney; there can be no doubt that a cyclone would be
    established, and the fog effectually dissipated. The cost would
    be slight, and the pipe of tobacco would afford a welcome treat
    to many a poor fellow out of work in these hard times.</p>

    <p>I hopes as I shall not be blamed for my hordacity in writin

    Amerrycan frend. He says as it's my bounden dooty to do so, if
    ony to prove the trooth of the old prowerb that tells us, "that
    Waiters rushes in where Docters fears to tread!" He's pleased
    to say as he has never bin in better helth than all larst
    Jennewerry at the Grand Hotel, and that he owes it all to my
    sage adwice.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"Allers let Nater be your Dick Tater!" In depressin times
    like these here, keep the pot a bilin' so to speak; and stand
    firm to the three hesses, Soup, Shampane, and Sunlight.</p>

    <p>The Soup must be Thick Turtel, such as Natur purwides in
    this here cold seeson, not the Thin Turtel of Summer. The
    Shampane must be Rich Clicko, or the werry best Pummery, sitch
    as you can taste the ginerous grapes in, not the pore dry stuff
    as young Swells drinks, becoz they're told as how it's
    fashnabel; and the Sunlight can ginerally be got if you knows
    where to look for it. For instance now, in one of the cold
    foggy days of last month, my Amerrycan frend said to me, "What
    on airth, ROBERT, can a gentleman find to do on sitch a orful
    day as this?" So sez I, "Take a Cab to Wictoria Station, and go
    to the Cristel Pallis, wark about in the brillient sunshine as
    you will find there a waiting for you, for about two howers,
    not a moment longer, then cum strait back, and you shall find a
    lovly lunch."</p>

    <p>And off he went, a larfing to think how he would emuse
    himself when he came back by pitching into pore me. But it does
    so happen as Waiters ain't not quite so deaf as sum peeple
    thinks 'em, and I've offen 'erd peeple say, that amost always,
    if you sees the Sun a trying for to peep thro the fog, and see
    how we all gits on without him, a leetle way out of town, on an
    'ill, you will see him a shining away like fun!</p>

    <p>Well, xacly at 2:30, in cums my frend, a grinnin away like
    the fablus Chesher Cat, and he says, says he, why Mr. ROBERT,
    you're a reglar conjurer! It was all xacly as you prosefied! I
    had two hours' glorious stroll in the Cristel Pallis Gardings
    in the lovly sunshine!</p>

    <p>Hin ten minutes' time he was seated at a purfekly luvly
    lunch, and a peggin away with sitch a happytight as princes
    mite enwy!</p>

    <p>In times like these, dine out reglar either two or three
    times a week, and drink generusly, but wisely, not too well,
    and on receiving the accustomed At, think of the ard times the
    pore Waiter has had to pass through lately, and dubble, or ewen
    tribbel the accustumd Fee. You'll never miss it, but, on the
    contrairy, will sleep all the sounder for it.</p>

    <p>Never read no accounts in Noosepapers of hillnesses and
    sich-like, and keep a few little sixpences in your ticket
    pocket; then if a pore woman arsks you if you have a penny to
    spare, say no, but praps this will do as well, and give her a
    sixpence, and then see her look of estonished rapcher, aye, and
    ewen share it to some small degree.</p>

    <p>Check a frown, and encouridge a smile, and the one will
    wanish away, and the other dewelope into a larf. Let your
    principle virtues be ginerosity and ope, and allers look on the
    brite side of ewerythink, as the Miller said to the Sweep.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
